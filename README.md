Linux project by G17-Linux-PID-11. Title - User Session Logger

1. Abstract 
 
The User Session Logger is a Python-based tool developed for the Linux Administration course to 
demonstrate user activity tracking on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This project implements a command-line an 
application that records user session details, including username, login time, logout time, and session duration, 
storing them persistently in a text file (session_log.txt). Featuring a menu-driven interface, the tool allows users 
to log sessions, view logged data, and exit, with robust error handling for invalid date formats and logical 
timestamp errors. Leveraging Linux file system operations and Pythonâ€™s datetime and OS libraries, the project 
showcases fundamental system administration concepts such as file I/O, input validation, and user interaction in 
a Linux environment. The implementation is lightweight, efficient, and adheres to secure file management 
practices, making it suitable for educational purposes. While the current scope focuses on manual input for 
simplicity, the project lays a foundation for future enhancements, such as real-time session tracking and 
graphical interfaces, contributing to a deeper understanding of Linux-based user monitoring.
